    A **growth mindset** is the belief that your abilities and intelligence can be developed through:
    - Hard work
    - Perseverance 
    - Learning from mistakes
    
    This concept was popularized by psychologist **Carol Dweck**. It challenges the fixed mindset notion that our skills are static.
